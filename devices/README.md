# Devices Script

This is a bash script that will log in and fetch the first page of devices.

It will prompt you for username, password and host name. If successful, it will login
and fetch the first page of devices. In addition to writing them to the console they will
be stored in a file named `output/devices.json`.

```shell
$ ./devices
username: john
password:
host: pc1

## Output

If everything works correctly, the `output` directory will contain 5 files:

```shell
$ ls output
access_token.txt     devices.json        login-result.json
devices-headers.txt  login-headers.txt
```

Here is a description of each file

| File                | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| login-headers.txt   | The headers from the login request, if headers were received.  |
| login-result.json   | The response from the login request, if any was received.      |
| access_token.txt    | The access_token extracted from the login-result.json file     |
| devices-headers.txt | The headers from the devices request, if headers were received |
| devices.json        | The response from the devices request, if any was received     |

If something goes wrong these files will contain the headers and response bodies to help you
debug.

## Protect The Access Token

You must protect any access token you get from the Metasys Server. Anyone with access to this token
can impersonate you for the life of the session associated with that token.

This program stores an access token in two files in the `output/` directory (`output/login-result.json` and `output/access_token.txt`).

> **This is solely for
educational purposes to allow a developer to inspect the results. This is not a recommended practice for a production system. You are responsible for protecting your access tokens.**

## Certificate Issues

Curl checks the certificates of your server. If the certificate is not trusted then the curl operations will fail. Here are some workarounds. See [SSL Certification Verification](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html) for more information.

1. Manually add the certificate to your local keystore and mark it as trusted
2. Export the certificate in pem format and pass it on the command line. The following example assumes you have done this and named the file `server-certificate.pem`

    ```shell
    ./devices --ca-cert server-certificate.pem
    ```
3. Use the `--insecure` option. **Note:** this is not recommended for production environments.

    ```shell
    ./devices --insecure
    ```
